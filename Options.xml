      When enabled, debug entries will be sent to the Message Queue any time (with few exceptions) they would be sent to Player.log.
      At higher levels of verbosity, this can be {{r|very}} "loud" and spammy.

      The default is {{w|Disabled}}.

      When enabled, internal debug information relating to the Blink mutation will be displayed when [{{W|l}}]ooking at anything with the relevant parts.

    <helptext>
      When enabled, blinking through or into hostile creatures results in the blinking creature emitting a "shout" based on the result of their blink.
      
      At higher levels, the short cooldown and the cooldown being refreshed when dealing damage results in a fair amount of on-screen visual clutter during fights.
      
      It's worth trying for a bit and turning off if you find it too obnoxious.

      The default is {{w|Enabled}}.
