      <p>You were turned to the darkness and lost part of your ear in a battle, that's why it's missing.</p>

			<p>While {{coldsteel|Cold Steel}} is active, blinking through a hostile creature teleports you behind them and makes a free attack.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Hitting with this attack deals an additional {{rules|<stat Name="ColdSteelDamage" />}} {{coldsteel|Cold Steel}} damage which cannot be blocked.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Killing an enemy with your {{coldsteel|Cold Steel}} damage keeps your {{rules|Blink}} off its cooldown.</p>
